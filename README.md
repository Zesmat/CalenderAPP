# Calendar Application 

A comprehensive calendar application designed to help users manage various types of events, such as meetings, appointments, and birthdays. This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Constructor Chaining**
- **Deep Copy Constructors**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Abstract Classes**
- **Interfaces**
- **Method Overriding**
- **Polymorphism**

  The application allows users to create, share, and receive notifications for events, making it a robust tool for personal and collaborative scheduling.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
![UML](https://github.com/SuzyAdel/CalenderAPP/assets/128175020/bf09a56d-c01e-47c3-9dcc-c453c5265fc6)


### Inheritance
- **Event** is an abstract class extended by **Meeting**, **Appointment**, and **Birthday**.

### Polymorphism
- The `addReminder` method in **Event** is overridden by the subclasses.

### Encapsulation
- Attributes are private or protected, accessed via public getter and setter methods.

### Deep Copy Constructors
- Ensures independent copies of objects for **User**, **Calendar**, **Event**, **Meeting**, **Appointment**, **Birthday**, and **Reminder**.

### Interfaces
- The **Notifiable** interface is implemented by **User**.

- **Event Type Dropdown**: Users can choose the type of event (Appointment, Meeting, Birthday) from a dropdown list.
- **Input Fields**: Based on the selected event type, the interface provides specific input fields:
  - **Title**: A text box to enter the event title.
  - **Description**: A text box to enter a description of the event.
  - **Time**: A text box to specify the time of the event.
  - **Location**: A text box to specify the location of the event.
  - **Participants**: (Only for Meetings) A text box or list to add participants.
  - **Doctor**: (Only for Appointments) A field to specify the doctor's name.
  - **Person Name**: (Only for Birthdays) A field to specify the name of the person whose birthday it is.
- **Add Button**: After filling in the required details, users can click the "Add" button to save the event.

#### 3. Event Visualization
<img src="https://github.com/SuzyAdel/CalenderAPP/assets/128175020/64ea84bc-80d6-4b45-b170-091751755529" alt="Event Visualization" width="550">

- **Color Coding**: Each type of event is color-coded for easy differentiation on the calendar:
  - **Yellow**: For Birthdays
  - **Green**: For Appointments
  - **Blue**: For Meetings
- **Shading**: The days on the calendar are shaded with the corresponding color when an event is added, providing a quick visual representation of scheduled events.

## Example Usage in CalendarMain

The `CalendarMain` class demonstrates how to use the calendar application:

- **Create Users and Calendars**: A user named Alice is created with a work calendar.
- **Add Events**: Different types of events (meeting, appointment, birthday) are added to the calendar.
- **Add Reminders**: Reminders are added to events to notify users.
- **Share Calendars**: The calendar is shared with another user, Bob.
- **Process Events**: Events are processed to demonstrate polymorphism by checking the event type and displaying specific information about the event.

This example highlights the creation and management of events, the use of deep copying to ensure data integrity, and the implementation of polymorphic behavior to handle different event types dynamically.
